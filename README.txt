1st Lesson: ===============================================================

1. Printing

print("x")
- x = text of some kind

a = value
print(f"The value of a is: {a}")
- use f before string to call in a variable directly into the string

2. Defining a function

def x()
- x = name of function
- () inside brackets can be left empty or have values (if many values, separate by commas)

3. Operators

if / elif / else
==
!=
or

4. Handling exceptions

try:
    .........
except:
    .........

- dots replaced with codes and functions

5. Ranges

range(x) - stops at x
range(x, y) - starts at x, stops at y
range(x, y, z) - starts at x, stops at y, skipping by steps z

Example x, y, z:

rage(10, 5, -2) => 10, 8, 6

2nd Lesson: ==================================================================

6. Lists

Declared with [ ]

In Python you can mix strings and integers in a list.

.append() - adds to the last position of the list
.insert(index position, value) - adds to a specific position of the list
.remove(value already available in list) - removes a specific value from the list
.pop(index position) - remove a value which is at the specified index position
.count(value) - counts the number of recurrences of the specified value in the list

7. Tuples

Declared with ( )

It is UNCHANGEABLE after it has been created - cannot add/remove/change

8. Dictionaries

Declared with { }

Used to store data in "key": "data" pairs.
